## Reddit Image Easy Scroller Extension
- Normally on reddit posts with image albums, you cannot zoom them and have to move left and right by manually clicking the buttons with mouse (you cannot use left and right arrow keys.)
- With this firefox extension, the image albums can be shown on new tabs, with zoom and scroll functionalities.

### How to Use
- Open reddit post with image gallery (for example, this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1e72b7l/most_recent_images_of_earth/)
- Click on Reddit Image Easy Scroller Extension in your extension list.
- Click `Open Gallery in new Tab`.
- A new tab should be opened with all the pictures that you can scroll down. Enjoy.

### Caution
- The lazy loading apparently does not work because there are no fixed heights. Be careful of using up your internet quota if exists.
- Not tested if there are more than a hundred pictures. Use with your own discretion and be aware of the potential performance problem.

### Development Notes
- Reddit differentiates the structure between reddit post with 1 picture and multiple pictures with gallery carousel, hence a separate function for this.
